Finance Team,

I need you to handle a CONFIDENTIAL and URGENT matter. Due to a sensitive merger opportunity that just came up, we need to wire $250,000 immediately to secure the deal. This is time-sensitive and highly confidential.

Please wire the funds to:
Bank: First International Bank
Account: 98765432
Routing: 021000021
Amount: $250,000 USD

DO NOT discuss this with anyone. Reply ASAP to confirm receipt.

This deal expires TODAY if we don't act now.

Managing Director
