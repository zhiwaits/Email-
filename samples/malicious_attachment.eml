Dear Employee,

Per IRS requirements, we need to update your W-2 information for the 2024 tax filing season.

Please download and execute the attached form to update your tax records. This form will automatically connect to our secure payroll system.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to enable macros when prompted to ensure proper functionality.

The form must be completed by Friday to avoid penalties.
