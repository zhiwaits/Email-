Hi Attorney Johnson,

I wanted to follow up on the Henderson v. Smith contract we discussed in our meeting last week. I've reviewed the settlement terms and have a few questions about the liability clause on page 7.

Could you schedule a call this week to discuss? I'm available Tuesday or Wednesday after 2 PM.

The document is attached for your reference. Let me know your availability.

Best regards,
